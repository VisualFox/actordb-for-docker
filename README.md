A project to get [ActorDB](http://www.actordb.com) running with [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Dockerfile
There's a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/bytepixie/actordb-for-docker/blob/master/build/Dockerfile) and useful [README.md](https://github.com/bytepixie/actordb-for-docker/blob/master/build/README.md) in the [builds](https://github.com/bytepixie/actordb-for-docker/tree/master/build) folder which is used to build the [Docker Hub images](https://hub.docker.com/r/bytepixie/actordb/).

## Docker Compose
The root of this project has a very rudimentary [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/bytepixie/actordb-for-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file that will possibly help some people out.
